## Imporvements made

### Removal of extra `<div>` elements

In the provided HTML code, unnecessary `<div>` (the `header` tag was a class inside the `div` element) elements were replaced with more semantic and meaningful HTML5 elements. For example, the `<header>` tag was introduced to enclose the header content, and the `<nav>` tag was used to wrap the navigation links. By using these semantic tags, the code becomes more structured and easier to understand.
